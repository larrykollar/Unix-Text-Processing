.chapter 6 "The \f(CBmm\fP Macros" "Chapter" 1
.LP
.page 128
A macro package provides a way of describing the format of
various kinds of documents.
Each document presents its own
specific problems, and macros help to provide a simple and
flexible solution.
The
.CW mm
macro package is designed to help
you format letters, proposals, memos, technical papers, and reports.
A text file that contains
.CW mm
macros can be processed by either
.CW nroff
or
.CW troff ,
the two text formatting programs in
UNIX.
The output from these programs can be displayed on a
terminal screen or printed on a line printer, a laser printer,
or a typesetter.
.PP
Some users of the
.CW mm
macro package learn only a few macros
and work productively.
Others choose from a variety of macros
to produce a number of different formats.
More advanced users
modify the macro definitions and extend the capabilities of
the package by defining their own special-purpose macros.
.PP
Macros are the
.I words
that make up a format description language.
Like words, the result of a macro is often determined
by context.
That is, you may not always understand your
output by looking up an individual macro, just like you may
not understand the meaning of an entire sentence by looking
up a particular word.
Without examining the macro definition,
you may find it hard to figure out which macro is causing a
particular result.
Macros are interrelated; some macros call
other macros, like a subroutine in a program, to perform a
particular function.
.PP
After finding out what the macro package allows you to do,
you will probably decide upon a particular format that you like
(or one that has evolved according to the decisions of a group
of people).
To describe that format, you are likely to use only
a few of the macros, those that do the job.
In everyday use,
you want to minimize the number of codes you need to format
documents in a consistent manner.
.Ah "Formatting a Text File
.LP
To figure out the role of a macro package such as
.CW mm ,
it may help to consider the distinction between
.I formatting
and
.I format .
Formatting is an operation, a process of supplying and
executing instructions.
You can achieve a variety of results,
some pleasing,
.page 129
some not, by any combination of
formatting instructions.
A format is a consistent product,
achieved by a selected set of formatting instructions.
A macro
package makes it possible for a format to be recreated again
and again with minimal difficulty.
It encourages the user to
concentrate more on the requirements of a document and less
on the operations of the text formatter.
.PP
Working with a macro package will help reduce the number
of formatting instructions you need to supply.
This means that a macro package will take care of many things
automatically.
However, you should gradually become familiar
with the operations of the
.CW nroff /\c
.CW troff
formatter and the
additional flexibility it offers to define new formats.
If you have a basic understanding of how the formatter works,
as described in Chapter 4, you will find it easier to learn
the intricacies of a macro package.
.Bh "Invoking \f(CBnroff\fP/\f(CBtroff\fP with \f(CBmm\fP
.ix [mm] macros, invoking %key mm macros, invoking
.LP
The
.CW mm
.ix [mm] command %key mm command
command is a shell script that invokes the
.CW nroff
formatter and reads in the files that contain the
.CW mm
macro
definitions before processing the text file(s) specified on
the command line.
.Ps
$ \f(CBmm\fP \fIoption(s) filename(s)\fP
.Pe
.LP
If more than one file is specified on the command line, the
files are concatenated before processing.
There are a variety
of options for invoking preprocessors and postprocessors,
naming an output device, and setting various number registers
to alter default values for a document.
Using the
.CW mm
command is the same as invoking
.CW nroff
explicitly with the
.CW -mm
option.
.PP
Unless you specify otherwise, the
.CW mm
command sets
.CW nroff 's
.CW -T
option to the terminal type set in your login environment.
By default, output is sent to the terminal screen.
If you have problems viewing your output, or if you have
a graphics terminal, you may want to specify another
device name using the
.CW -T
option.
For a list of available devices, see
.pdfhref L -D AppendixB -P . -- Appendix B
The
.CW mm
command also has a
.CW -c
option, which invokes the
.CW col
filter to remove reverse linefeeds, and options to invoke
.CW tbl
.CW -t ) (
and
.CW eqn
.CW -e ). (
.PP
When you format a file to the screen, the output usually streams
by too swiftly to read, just as when you
.CW cat
.ix [cat] command %key cat command
a file to the screen.
Pipe the output of the
.CW mm
command through either of the
paging programs,
.CW pg
.ix [pg] command %key pg command
or
.CW more ,
.ix [more] command %key more command
to view one screenful at a time.
This will give you a general indication that the formatting
commands achieved the results you had expected.
To print a file formatted with
mm, simply pipe the output to the print spooler (e.g.,
.CW lp )
.ix [lp] command %key lp command
instead of to a screen paging program.
.PP
Many of the actions that a text formatter performs are dependent
upon how the document is going to be printed.
If you want your document to be formatted with
.CW troff
instead of
.CW nroff ,
use the
.CW mmt
.ix [mmt] command %key mmt command
command (another shell script) or invoke
.CW troff
directly, using the
.CW -mm
option.
The
.CW mmt
command prepares output for laser printers and typesetters.
The formatted output should be piped directly to the print
spooler (e.g.,
.CW lp )
or directed to a file and printed separately.
You will probably need to check at your site for
the proper invocation of
.CW mmt
if your site supports more than
one type of laser printer or typesetter.
.page 130
.PP
If you are using
.CW otroff ,
be sure you don't let
.CW troff
send the
output to your terminal because, in all probability, it will
cause your terminal to hang, or at least to scream and holler.
.PP
In this chapter, we will generally show the results of the
.CW mm
command, rather than
.CW mmt \c
\(emthat is, we'll be showing
.CW nroff
rather than
.CW troff .
Where the subject under discussion is better
demonstrated by
.CW troff ,
we will show
.CW troff
output instead.
We assume that by now, you will be able to tell which of the
programs has been used, without our mentioning the actual
commands.
.Bh "Problems in Getting Formatted Output
.ix [mm] macros, errors %key mm macros, errors
.ix errors, in [mm] %key errors, in mm
.LP
When you format an
.CW mm -coded
document, you may only get a portion
of your formatted document.
Or you may get none of it.
Usually, this is because the formatter has had a problem executing
the codes as they were entered in the input file.
Most of the time
it is caused by omitting one of the macros that must be used
in pairs.
.PP
When formatting stops like this, one or more error messages
might appear on your screen, helping you to diagnose the
problems.
These messages refer to the line numbers in the
input file where the problems appear to be, and try to tell
you what is missing:
.Ps
\f(CBERROR\fP\fR:(\fP\fIfilename\fP\fR)\fP \fIline number\fP
\fI   Error message\fP
.Pe
.LP
Sometimes, you won't get error messages, but your output will
break midway.
Generally, you have to go in the file at the
point where it broke, or before that point, and examine the
macros or a sequence of macros.
You can also run a program
on the input file to examine the code you have entered.
This program, available at most sites, is called
.CW checkmm .
.ix [checkmm] command %key checkmm command

.CW nroff .
It might be interesting, before putting any macros in
the file, to see what happens if we format
.CW letter
as it is, this time using the
.CW mm
command to read in the

Mr. John Fust Vice President, Research and
Development Gutenberg Galaxy Software Waltham,
Massachusetts 02159
.sp
Dear Mr. Fust:
.sp
In our conversation last Thursday, we discussed a
documentation project that would produce a user's
manual on the Alcuin product. Yesterday, I
received the product demo and other materials that
you sent me.
.sp
Going through a demo session gave me a much better
understanding of the product.  I confess to being
amazed by Alcuin.  Some people around here,
looking over my shoulder, were also astounded by
the illustrated manuscript I produced with Alcuin.
One person, a student of calligraphy, was really
impressed.
.sp
In the next couple of days, I'll be putting
together a written plan that presents different
strategies for documenting the Alcuin product.
After I submit this plan, and you have had time to
review it, let's arrange a meeting at your company
to discuss these strategies.
.sp
Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to bid
on this documentation project.  I hope we can
decide upon a strategy and get started as soon as
possible in order to have the manual ready in time
for the first customer shipment. I look forward to
meeting with you towards the end of next week.
.sp

.ix page~layout, in [mm] %key page layout, in mm
.LP
.page 132
When you format a page with
.CW mm ,
the formatter is instructed to
provide several lines at the top and the bottom of the page
for a header and a footer.
By default, a page number appears
on a single line in the header and only blank lines are printed
for the footer.
.PP
There are basically two different ways to change the default
header and footer.
The first way is to specify a command-line
parameter with the
.CW mm
or
.CW mmt
commands to set the number
register
.CW N .
This allows you to affect how pages are numbered
and where the page number appears.
The second way is to specify
in the input file a macro that places text in the header or
footer.
Let's look at both of these techniques.
.Bh "Setting Page Numbering Style
.ix [mm] macros, page~numbering styles %key mm macros, page numbering styles
.ix %begin page number, in [mm] %key page number, in mm
.LP
When you format a document, pages are numbered in sequence
up to the end of the document.
This page number is usually
printed in the header, set off by dashes.
.Ps
-1-
.Pe
.LP
Another style of page numbering, used in documents such
as technical manuals, numbers pages specific to a section.
The first page of the second section would be printed as:
.Ps
2-1
.Pe
.LP
The other type of change affects whether or not the page number
is printed in the header at the top of the first page.
.PP
The number register
.CW N
controls these actions.
This register has a default setting of 0
and can take values from 0 through 5.
Table 6-1 shows the effect of these values.

All of these macros have the same

For example, we could place the name of a client, the title
of the document, and the date in the page header, and we could
place the page number in the footer:
.Ps

A document formatted by

produces, by default,
unjustified text (an uneven or ragged-right margin).
When formatted by
.CW troff ,
.ix [troff] formatter, justification using [mm] %key troff formatter, justification using [mm]
the same document is automatically justified
(the right margin is even).
.PP
If you are using both

it is probably a good
idea to explicitly set justification on or off rather than
depend upon the default chosen by the formatter.

.LP
One way to achieve better line breaks and more evenly filled
lines is to instruct the formatter to perform word hyphenation.
.PP
Hyphenation is turned off in the
.CW mm
macro package.
This means
that the formatter does not try to hyphenate words
to make them fit on a line unless you request it by setting
the number register
.CW Hy
to 1.
If you want the formatter to
automatically hyphenate words, insert the following line at
the top of your file:
.page 138
.Ps
\&.nr Hy 1
.Pe
.LP
Most of the time, the formatter breaks up a word correctly
when hyphenating.
Sometimes, however, it does not and you have
to explicitly tell the formatter either how to split a word
(using the
.CW \&.hy
request) or not to hyphenate at all (using the
.CW \&.nh
request).

When we format a text file, the line breaks caused by carriage
returns are ignored by
.CW nroff /\c
.CW troff .
How text is entered on lines
in the input file does not affect how lines are formed in the
output.
It doesn't really matter whether information is typed
on three lines or four; it appears the same after formatting.
.PP
You probably noticed that the name and address at the beginning
of our sample file did not come out in block form.
The four
lines of input ran together and produced two filled lines
of output:
.Ps

.LP
The formatter, instead of paying attention to carriage returns,
acts on specific macros or requests that cause a break, such as
.CW \&.P ,
.CW \&.SP ,
or a blank line.
The formatter request
.CW \&.br
is probably the simplest way to break a line:
.Ps
Mr. John Fust

.LP
The
.CW \&.br
request is most appropriate when you are forcing a
break of a single line.
For larger blocks of text, the
.CW mm
macro package provides a pair of macros for indicating that a block
of text should be output just as it was entered in the input
file.

The formatter does not fill these lines, so the address block

Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to bid on this

We have worked through some of the problems presented by a
very simple one-page letter.
As we move on, we will
be describing specialized macros that address the problems of
multiple page documents, such as proposals and reports.
In many
ways, the macros for more complex documents are the feature
performers in a macro package, the ones that really convince
you that a markup language is worth learning.
.Ah "Changing Font and Point Size
.LP
When you format with
.CW nroff
and print on a line printer, you
can put emphasis on individual words or phrases by underlining
or overstriking.
When you are using
.CW troff
and send your output
to a laser printer or typesetter, you can specify variations
of type, font, and point size based on the capabilities of
the output device.
.Bh "Roman, Italic, and Bold Fonts
.LP
Most typefaces have at least three fonts available:
roman,
.ix [mm] macros, roman font %key mm macros, roman font
.B bold,
.ix [mm] macros, bold font %key mm macros, bold font
and
.I italic .
.ix [mm] macros, italic font %key mm macros, italic font
Normal body copy is printed in the roman font.
You can change temporarily to a bold or italic font
for emphasis.
In Chapter 4, you learned how to specify font
changes using the
.ix [mm] macros, changing fonts %key mm macros, changing fonts
.CW \&.ft
request and inline
.CW \ef
requests.
The
.CW mm
package provides a set of mnemonic macros for changing fonts:
.RS
.TS

.ix %begin [.R] macro ([mm]) %key R macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.R] macro %key mm macros, R macro
.RE
.LP
Each macro prints a single argument in a particular font.
You might code a single sentence as follows:
.Ps
\&.B Alcuin
revitalizes an
\&.I age-old
tradition.
.Pe
.LP
The printed sentence has a word in bold and one in italic.
(In
.CW nroff ,
bold space is simulated by overstriking, and italics
by underlining).

until it is explicitly changed:
.Ps

.sp
.Pe
.SE
.sp .8v
.PP
You've already seen that the first argument is changed to the
selected font.
If you supply a second argument, it is printed in the previous font.
Each macro takes up to six arguments for alternating font changes.
(An argument is set off by a space; a phrase
must be enclosed within quotation marks to be taken as a
single argument). A good use for the alternate argument is
to supply punctuation, especially because of the restriction
that you cannot begin an input line with a period.
.Ps
its opposite is
\&.B cacography .

If you specify alternate arguments consisting of words or

.ix %begin [mm] macros, changing point~size %key mm macros, changing point size
.ix %begin point~size, changing ([mm]) %key point size, changing mm
.LP
When formatting with
.CW troff ,
you can request a larger or smaller
point size for the type.
A change in the point size affects how much
vertical space is needed for the larger or smaller characters.
Normal body copy is set in 10-point type with the
vertical spacing 2 points larger.

.Pe
.ix %begin [.S] macro ([mm]) %key S macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.S] macro %key mm macros, S macro
.LP
The values for
.I "point size"
and
.I "vertical spacing"
can be set in relation to the current setting:
.CW +
increments and
.CW -
decrements the current value.
For example, you could specify relative point size changes:
.Ps
\&.S +2 +2
.Pe
.LP
or absolute ones:
.Ps
\&.S 12 14
.Pe
.LP
By default, if you don't specify vertical spacing, a relation
of 2 points greater than the point size will be maintained.
A null value ("") does not change the current setting.
.PP
The new point size and vertical spacing remain
in effect until you change them.
Simply entering the
.CW \&.S

The difference between them has to do with what happens when
a display cannot fit in its entirety on the current page.
Both the static and the floating display output the block at
the top of the next page if it doesn't fit on the current page;
however, only the floating display allows text that follows
the display to be used to fill up the preceding page.
A static
display maintains the order in which a display was placed in
the input file.
.PP
We have already used
.CW \&.DS
and
.CW \&.DE
to mark the beginning and end of a static display.
To specify a floating display, the
closing mark is the same, but the beginning is marked by the
.CW \&.DF

.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.DF] macro %key mm macros, DF macro

If there had been room on page 1 to fit the display, it would
have been placed there, and lines 6 and 7 would have followed
the display, as they did in the input file.
.PP
If a static display had been specified, the display would
be placed in the same position on page 2, and lines 6 and 7
would have to follow it, leaving extra space at the bottom of
page 1.
A floating display attempts to make the best use of
the available space on a page.
.PP
The formatter maintains a queue to hold floating displays that
it has not yet output.
When the top of a page is encountered,
the next display in the queue is output.
The queue is emptied
in the order in which it was filled, (first in, first out).
Two number registers,
.CW De
and
.CW Df ,
allow you to control when
displays are removed from the queue and placed in position.
.PP
At the end of a section, as indicated by the section macros
.CW \&.H

.CW \&.HU
(which we will see shortly), or at the end of the
input file, any floating displays that remain in the queue
will be placed in the document.

You can provide a title or caption for tables, equations,

In addition, the display can be labeled

.PP
All of these macros work the same way and are usually specified
within a pair of
.CW .DS /\c
.CW .DE
macros, so that the title and the
display appear on the same page.
Each macro can be followed by a title.
If the title contains spaces, it should be enclosed
within quotation marks.
The title of a table usually appears at
the top of a table, so it must be specified before the
.CW \&.TS
macro that signals to
.CW tbl
the presence of a table (see Chapter 8).

Second and third arguments, specified with the label macros,
can be used to modify or override the default numbering of

Basically, the second argument is a literal and
the third argument a numeric value that specifies what the
literal means.

Thus, a pair of related tables could be specified as 1a and

These pairs
of delimiters indicate a block to be processed by a specific
.page 150
preprocessor.
You will find the information about each of
the preprocessors in Chapters 8 through 10.
As mentioned, the
preprocessor creates the display, the display macros position
it, and the label macros add titles and a number.
.PP
Although it may seem a minor point, each of these steps is
independent, and because they are not fully integrated, there
is some overlap.
.PP
The label macros, being independent of the preprocessors,
do not make sure that a display exists or check whether a
table has been created with
.CW tbl .
You can create a two-column
table using tabs or create a figure using character symbols
and still give it a label.
Or you can create a table heading
as the first line of your table and let
.CW tbl
process it
.CW tbl "" (
won't provide a number and the table won't be collected for
the table of contents).
.PP
In
.CW tbl ,
you can specify a centered table and not use the
.CW .DS /\c
.CW .DE
macros.
But, as a consequence,
.CW nroff /\c
.CW troff
won't make
a very good attempt at keeping the table together on one page,
and you may have to manually break the page.
It is recommended
that you use the display macros throughout a document,
regardless of whether you can get the same effect another way,
because if nothing else you will achieve consistency.
.Ah "Forcing a Page Break
.LP
Occasionally, you may want to force a page break, whether to
ensure that a block of related material is kept together

.Ah "Formatting Lists
.ix %begin [mm] macros, lists %key mm macros, lists
.ix %begin lists, [mm] macros %key lists, mm macros
.LP
The
.CW mm
macro package provides a variety of different formats for
presenting a list of items.
You can select from four standard
list types:
.RS
.Ls B
.Li
bulleted
.Li
dashed
.Li
numbered
.Li
alphabetized
.Le
.RE
.page 151
.LP
In addition, you have the flexibility to create lists with
nonstandard marks or text labels.
The list macros can also be
used to produce paragraphs with a hanging indent.
.PP
Each list item consists of a special mark, letter,
number, or label in a left-hand column with a
paragraph of text indented in a right-hand column.
.Bh "Structuring a List
.LP
The list macros help to simplify what could be a much larger
and tedious formatting task.
Here's the coding for the bulleted list just shown:
.Ps
\&.BL
\&.LI
bulleted
\&.LI
dashed
\&.LI
numbered
\&.LI
alphabetized
\&.LE
.Pe
.LP
The structure of text in the input file has three parts:
a list-initialization macro
.CW .BL ), (
.ix [.BL] macro ([mm]) %key BL macro mm
.ix [mm] macros, [.BL] macro %key mm macros, BL macro
an item-mark macro
.CW .LI ), (
.ix %begin [.LI] macro ([mm]) %key LI macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.LI] macro %key mm macros, LI macro
and a list-end macro
.CW .LE ). (
.ix %begin [.LE] macro ([mm]) %key LE macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.LE] macro %key mm macros, LE macro
.PP
First, you initialize the list, specifying the particular
macro for the type of list that you want.
For instance,
.CW BL
initializes a bulleted list.
.PP
You can specify arguments with the list-initialization macro
that change the indentation of the text and turn off the
automatic spacing between items in the list.
We will examine
these arguments when we look at the list-initialization macros
in more detail later.
.PP
Next, you specify each of the items in the list.
The item-mark
macro,
.CW \&.LI ,
is placed before each item.
You can enter one or more lines of text following the macro.
.Ps
\&.BL
\&.LI
Item 1
\&.LI
Item 2
\&.LI
Item 3
.Pe
.LP
When the list is formatted, the
.CW \&.LI
macro provides a line of space before each item.
(This line can be omitted through
an argument to the list-initialization macro if you want to
produce a more compact list.
We'll be talking more about this
in a moment).
.PP
The
.CW \&.LI
macro can also be used to override or prefix the current mark.
If a mark is supplied as the only argument,
it replaces the current mark.
For example:
.page 152
.Ps
\&.LI o
Item 4
.Pe
.LP
If a mark is supplied as the first argument, followed by a
second argument of 1, then the specified mark is prefixed to
the current mark.
The following:
.Ps
\&.LI - 1
Item 5
.Pe
.LP
would produce:
.sp .7v
.SS
.Ps
.ti 10n
\fB-\(bu\fP\fR     Item 5\fP
.sp
.Pe
.SE
.sp .8v
.PP
A text label can also be supplied in place of the mark, but it
presents some additional problems for the proper alignment of
the list.
We will look at text labels for variable-item lists.
.PP
The
.CW \&.LI
macro does not automatically provide spacing after
each list item.
An argument of 1 can be specified if a line
of space is desired.
.PP
The end of the list is marked by the list-end macro
.CW \&.LE .
It restores page formatting settings that were in effect prior to
the invocation of the last list-initialization macro.
The
.CW \&.LE
macro does not output any space following the list unless you
specify an argument of 1.
(Don't specify this argument when
the list is immediately followed by a macro that outputs space,
such as the paragraph macro).
.PP
Be sure you are familiar with the basic structure of a list.
A common problem is not closing the list with
.CW \&.LE .
Most of the time, this error causes the formatter
to quit at this point in the file.
A less serious, but nonetheless frequent, oversight
is omitting the first
.CW \&.LI
between the list-initialization
macro and the first item in the list.
The list is output but the first item will be askew.
.PP
Here is a sample list:
.Ps
\&.BL

Different types of lists can be nested,

you know which level you are at and remember to close each list.

You may already realize the ease with which you can make
changes to a list.
The items in a list can be easily put in a new order.
New items can be added to a numbered list
without readjusting the numbering scheme.
A bulleted list can be changed to an alphabetized list
by simply changing the list-initialization macro.
And you normally don't have to
be concerned with a variety of specific formatting requests,
such as setting indentation levels or specifying spacing
between items.
.PP
On the other hand, because the structure of the list is
not as easy to recognize in the input file as it is in the
formatted output, you may find it difficult to interpret
complicated lists, in particular ones that have been nested to
several levels.
The code checking program,
.CW checkmm ,
.ix [checkmm] command %key checkmm command
can help; in addition, you may want to format and print
repeatedly to examine and correct problems with lists.

Long a standby of technical documents, a marked list clearly
organizes a group of related items and sets them apart for easy
reading.
A list of items marked by a bullet (\(bu) is perhaps
the most common type of list.

a dash (\(em).
A third type of list allows the user to specify
a mark, such as a square (\(sq).

Because the bullets produced by

a dashed list provides a suitable alternative.
With the

same position as a bullet in a bulleted list.
A single space
is maintained between the dash and the text, which, like the
text with a bulleted list, is indented by the amount specified
in the number register for indented paragraphs
.CW Pi ). (
.PP
The
.CW nroff
formatter supplies a dash that is a single hyphen, and
.CW troff
supplies an em dash.
Because the em dash is longer,
and the dash is right justified, the alignment with the left
margin is noticeably different.
It appears left justified in

in

the dash appears indented several spaces

The third argument inhibits spacing between items in the list.
Additionally, the number register
.CW Ls
can be set to a
value from 0 to 6 indicating a nesting level.
Lists after this level will not have spacing between items.
The default is 6, the maximum nesting depth.
If
.CW Ls
were set to 2, lists only up to
the second level would have a blank line of space between items.

Other types of lists can be specified with
.CW \&.AL ,
using the first argument to specify the list type, as follows:

You can produce various list types by simply changing the
.I type
argument.
You can create a very useful outline format
by nesting different types of lists.
The example we show of
such an outline is one that is nested to four levels using
.CW I ,
.CW A ,
.CW 1 ,
and
.CW a ,
in that order.
The rather complicated looking
input file is shown in Figure 6-4 (indented for easier viewing
of each list, although it could not be formatted this way),
and the
.CW nroff -formatted
output is shown in Figure 6-5.

Another list-initialization macro that produces a numbered
list is
.CW \&.RL
.ix [.RL] macro ([mm]) %key RL macro mm
.ix [mm] macros, [.RL] macro %key mm macros, RL macro
.ix [mm] macros, reference lists %key mm macros, reference lists
.ix lists, reference ([mm]) %key lists, reference mm
.ix reference lists, [mm] macros %key reference lists, mm macros
.I "reference list" ). (
The only difference is that the
reference number is surrounded by brackets (\c
.CW [] ).
.Ps

Earlier we used the list macros to produce an indented outline.
That outline, indented to four levels, is a visual
representation of the structure of a document.
Headings perform
a related function, showing how the document is organized
into sections and subsections.
In technical documentation
and book-length manuscripts, having a structure that is easily
recognized by the reader is very important.
.Bh "Numbered and Unnumbered Headings
.LP
Using
.CW mm ,
you can have up to seven levels of numbered and
unnumbered headings, with variable styles.
There are two heading macros:
.CW \&.H
for numbered headings and
.ix %begin [.H] macro ([mm]) %key H macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.H] macro %key mm macros, H macro
.ix %begin [mm] macros, numbered headings %key mm macros, numbered headings
.CW \&.HU
for unnumbered headings.
.ix %begin [.HU] macro ([mm]) %key HU macro mm
.ix %begin [mm] macros, [.HU] macro %key mm macros, HU macro
.ix %begin [mm] macros, unnumbered headings %key mm macros, unnumbered headings
A different style for each level of heading can be
specified by setting various number registers and defining
strings.
.PP
Let's first look at how to produce numbered headings.
The syntax for the
.CW \&.H
macro is:
.Ps
.ft R
\f[CW]\&.H \fP\fIlevel\fP [\fIheading text\fP] [\fIheading suffix\fP]
.ft CW
.Pe
.LP
The simplest use of the
.CW \&.H
macro is to specify the
.I level
as a number between 1 and 7 followed by the text that is printed
as a heading.
If the
.I "heading text"
contains spaces, you should enclose it within quotation marks.
A heading that is longer
than a single line will be wrapped on to the next line.
A multiline heading will be kept together in case of a page break.
.PP
If you specify a
.I "heading suffix" ,
this text or mark will appear in the heading
but will not be collected for a table of contents.
.PP
A top-level heading is indicated by an argument of 1:
.Ps
\&.H 1 "Quick Tour of Alcuin"
.Pe
.page 163
.LP
The result is a heading preceded by a heading-level number.
The first-level heading has the number 1.
.Ps
1.  Quick Tour of Alcuin
.Pe
.LP
A second-level heading is indicated by an argument of 2:
.Ps
\&.H 2 "Introduction to Calligraphy"
.Pe
.LP
The first second-level heading number is printed:
.Ps
1.1  Introduction to Calligraphy
.Pe
.LP
When another heading is specified at the same level, the
heading-level number is automatically incremented.
If the next heading is at the second level:
.Ps
\&.H 2 "Digest of Alcuin Commands"
.Pe
.LP
it produces:
.Ps
1.2  Digest of Alcuin Commands
.Pe
.LP
Each time you go to a new (higher-numbered) level, .1 is
appended to the number representing the existing level.
That number is incremented for each call at the same level.
When you back out of a level (for instance, from level 5 to 4),
the counter for the level (in this case level 5), is reset to 0.
.PP
An unnumbered heading is really a zero-level heading:
.Ps
\&.H 0 "Introduction to Calligraphy"
.Pe
.PP
A separate macro,
.CW \&.HU ,
has been developed for unnumbered
headings, although its effect is the same.
.Ps
\&.HU "Introduction to Calligraphy"
.Pe
.LP
Even though an unnumbered heading does not display a number, it
increments the counter for second-level headings.
Thus, in the
following example, the heading \(lqIntroduction to
Calligraphy\(rq
is unnumbered, but it has the same effect on the numbering
scheme as if it had been a second-level heading (1.1).
.sp .7v
.SS
.Ps
1.  Quick Tour of Alcuin
.sp
Introduction to Calligraphy
.sp
1.2  Digest of Alcuin Commands
.sp
.Pe
.SE
.sp .8v
.PP
If you are going to intermix numbered and unnumbered headings,
you can change the number register
.CW Hu
to the lowest-level heading that is in the document.
By changing
.CW Hu
from 2 to a higher number:
.Ps
\&.nr Hu 5
\&.H 1 "Quick Tour of Alcuin"
\&.HU "Introduction to Calligraphy"
\&.H 2 "Digest of Alcuin Commands"
.Pe
.page 164
.LP
the numbering sequence is preserved for the numbered heading
following an unnumbered heading:
.sp .7v
.SS
.Ps

Headings are meant to be visible keys to your document's
structure.
If you are using unnumbered headings, it becomes
even more important to make headings stand out.
A simple thing
you can do is use uppercase letters for a first-level heading.

Here is a list of some of the other things you can do to affect

.LP
The basic issue in designing a heading style is to help the
reader distinguish between different levels of headings.
For instance, in an outline form, different levels of indent show
whether a topic is a section or subsection.
Using numbered headings is an effective way to accomplish this.
If you use
unnumbered headings, you probably want to vary the heading
style for each level, although, for practical purposes, you
should limit yourself to two or three levels.
.PP
First, let's look at what happens if we use the default
heading style.
.PP
The first two levels of headings are set up to produce
italicized text in
.CW troff
and underlined text in
.CW nroff .
After the heading, there is a blank line before
the first paragraph of text.
In addition, a top-level heading has two blank lines
before the heading; all the other levels have a single line
of space.

.Pe
.LP
If you do not specify a level, it defaults to 1.
Thus, in the previous example, level 6 and 7 headings
would be printed in a roman font.
.PP
The point size is set by the string
.CW HP .
Normally, headings are printed in the same size as the body
copy, except for bold headings.
A bold heading is reduced by 1 point when it
is a standalone heading, as are the top-level headings.
The
.CW HP
string can take up to seven arguments, setting the point
size for each level.
.Ps
\&.ds HP 14 14 12
.Pe
.LP
If an argument is not given, or a null value or 0 is given,
the default setting of 10 points is used for that level.
Point size can also be given relative to the current point size:
.Ps

.LP
For each of these number registers, you specify the number of
the level at which some action is to be turned on or off.
.page 166
.PP
The
.CW Ej
register is set to the highest-level heading, usually
1, that should start on a new page.
Its default setting is 0.

begin on their own page.
.Ps

.Pe
.LP
The
.CW Hb
register determines if a line break occurs after the heading.
The
.CW Hs
register determines if a blank line is output after the heading.
Both are set to 2 by default.
Settings of 2 mean that, for levels 1 and 2,
the section heading is printed,
followed by a line break and a blank line separating
the heading from the first paragraph of text.
For lower-level
headings (an argument greater than 2), the first paragraph
follows immediately on the same line.
.PP
The
.CW Hc
register is set to the highest-level heading that
you want centered.
Normally, this is not used with numbered
headings and its default value is 0.
However, unnumbered
heads are often centered.
A setting of 2 will center first- and second-level headings:
.Ps
\&.nr Hc 2
.Pe
.LP
With unnumbered headings, you also have to keep in mind that
the value of
.CW Hc
must be greater than or equal to
.CW Hb
and
.CW Hu .
The
heading must be on a line by itself; therefore a break must
be set in
.CW Hb
for that level.
The
.CW Hu
register sets the level
of an unnumbered heading to 2, requiring that
.CW Hc
be at least 2 to have an effect on unnumbered headings.
.PP
There really is no way, using these registers, to get the
first and second levels left justified and have the rest of
the headings centered.

Getting a table of contents easily and automatically is
almost reason enough to justify all the energy, yours and the
computer's, that goes into text processing.
You realize that
this is something that the computer was really meant to do.
.PP
When the table of contents page comes out of the printer, a
writer attains a state of happiness known only to a statistician
who can give the computer a simple instruction to tabulate
vast amounts of data and, in an instant, get a single piece
of paper listing the results.
.PP
The reason that producing a table of contents seems so easy is
that most of the work is performed in coding the document.
That means entering codes to
mark each level of heading and all the
figures, tables, exhibits, and equations.
Processing a table of contents
is simply a matter of telling the formatter to
collect the information that's already in the file.
.PP
There are only two simple codes to put in a file, one at the
beginning and one at the end, to generate a table of contents
automatically.
.PP
At the beginning of the file, you have to set the number
register
.CW Cl
to the level of headings that you want collected
for a table of contents.
For example, setting
.CW Cl
to 2 saves first- and second-level headings.
.PP
Place the
.CW \&.TC
.ix [.TC] macro ([mm]) %key TC macro mm
.ix [mm] macros, [.TC] macro %key mm macros, TC macro
macro at the end of the file.
This macro actually does the processing and formatting
of the table of contents.
The table of contents page is output at the end of a document.
.PP
A sample table of contents page follows.
The header \(lqCONTENTS\(rq
is printed at the top of the page.
At the bottom of the page,
lowercase roman numerals are used as page numbers.

.LP
Footnotes and references present special problems, as anyone
who has ever typed a term paper knows.
Fortunately,
.CW mm
has two pairs of specialized macros.
Both of them follow a marker
in the text and cause lines of delimited text to be saved
and output either at the bottom of the page, as a footnote,
or at end of the document, as a reference.
.Bh Footnotes
.ix %begin footnotes, [mm] macros %key footnotes, mm macros

A footnote is marked in the body of a document by the string
.CW \e*F .
It follows immediately after the text (no spaces).
.Ps

.Pe
.LP
The string
.CW F
supplies the number for the footnote.
It is printed (using
.CW troff )
as a superscript in the text and its value is
incremented with each use.

These macros surround the footnote text
that will appear at the bottom of the page.
The

the footnote text will be set in a type size 2
points less than the body copy.

you can specify the

Normally, the text of a footnote is indented from the left
margin and the mark or label is left justified in relation to
the start of the text.
It is possible that a long footnote could
run over to the next page.
Hyphenation is turned off so that a
word will not be broken at a page break.
These specifications
can be changed by giving a value between 0 and 11 as the first
argument with

document.
In addition, you can label a reference so that you
can refer to it later.
.page 172
.PP
A reference is marked where it occurs in the text with
.CW \e*(Rf .
The formatter converts the string into a value printed
in brackets, such as [1].
The mark is followed by a pair of

.ix [mm] macros, extensions~to %key mm macros, extensions to
.LP
So far, we have covered most but not all of the features of the
.CW mm
macro package.
.PP
We have not covered the Technical Memorandum macros, a set
of specialized macros for formatting technical memos and
reports.
Like the ones in the
.CW ms
macro package, these macros
were designed for internal use at AT&T's Bell Laboratories,
reflecting a company-wide set of standards.
Anyone outside of
Bell Labs will want to make some modifications to the macros
before using them.
The Technical Memorandum macros are a good
example of employing a limited set of user macros to produce
a standard format.
Seeing how they work will be especially
important to those who are responsible for implementing
documentation standards for a group of people, some of whom
understand the basics of formatting and some of whom do not.
.PP
Writing or rewriting macros is only one part of the process of
.ix [mm] macros, modifying %key mm macros, modifying
customizing
.CW mm .
The
.CW mm
macros were designed as a comprehensive
formatting system.
As we've seen, there are even macros to
replace common primitive requests, like
.CW \&.sp .
The developers of
.CW mm
recommend, in fact, that you not use
.CW nroff
or
.CW troff
requests unless absolutely necessary, lest you interfere with
the action of the macros.
.PP
Furthermore, as you will see if you print out the
.CW mm
macros, the internal code of
.CW mm
is extraordinarily dense, and uses
extremely un-mnemonic register names.
This makes it very
difficult for all but the most experienced user to modify the
basic structure of the package.
You can always add your own
macros, as long as they don't conflict with existing macro and
number register names, but you can't easily go in and change
the basic macros that make up the
.CW mm
package.
.PP
At the same time, the developers of
.CW mm
have made it possible
for the user to make selective modifications\(emthose which
.CW mm
has allowed mechanisms for in advance.
There are two such
mechanisms:
.RS

.CW \&.HZ
.ix [.HZ] macro ([mm]) %key HZ macro mm
.ix [mm] macros, [.HZ] macro %key mm macros, HZ macro

.PP
By default, these macros are undefined.
And, when
.CW troff
encounters an undefined macro name, it simply ignores it.
These macros thus lie hidden in the code until you define them.
By defining these macros, you can supplement the processing of
headings without actually modifying the
.CW mm
code.
Before you define these macros, be sure to study the
.CW mm
documentation for details of how to use them.

(In addition, you can redefine the

.ix [.TP] macro ([mm]) %key TP macro mm
.ix [mm] macros, [.TP] macro %key mm macros, TP macro
